Shiny Application
https://gcuenca2002.shinyapps.io/App_Plat/

Shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using the application.
Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
Share your server.R and ui.R code on github
The application must include the following:

Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
To include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
